# Ajax Exercise #1

## Part 1
Create a new webpage that does the following:

1) Get a list of all the users available at the https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ and display each user on the webpage. Display only their first and last name on the page and make sure it's clickable.
2) When a user clicks on the name, it your page should display their `username` and `email` in a panel below of on the side. Only 1 users information should be displayed at one time.
3) If feeling particularly daring, see if you can find all the `todos` for that user as well and output it to your webpage.


## Part 2

1) Apply the MVO design pattern to your application. Remember to think and plan before you act.
