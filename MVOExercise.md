## MVO Exercise

### Create a simple **Bookshelf** MVO application.

Requirements:

1) Must display at least 5 books on the page
2) Each book should have the following information displayed: 
    1) A cover shot of the book
    2) A title  
    3) The author
    4) The year it was released.
    

This application must be setup using the Model View Octopus pattern described in the previous class.

Your first step should be to plan. What is going to be your data (Model)? What is going to be your displayed on the page (your View) and how do you plan on gluing thos pieces together? Review the simple *Notes* MVO app for some ideas.

### Extend the Udacity **Notes** application.

#### Clearing all Notes
It would be great if we could actually clear our notes by clicking a button instead of having to use the console. The console works, but it's not very user friendly. Let's add a button that will do this for us!

Try to think about where the code should exist in the MVO pattern before you add it. Sometimes there isn't always a clear answer as to the code should be so everyones answer may differ a little.


#### Removing Individual Notes
Adding notes is great, but how about removing notes? I really feel like this application could be taken a step further and have notes removed. Without actually writing the code, look at how the current code is structured and plan out the following:

1) How would you remove notes?
2) What parts of the notes removal feature goes in the view? How about the model? What about the octopus?
3) Explain in some detail what functions you would add to each and how you would want to to work.
4) Try writing it!
